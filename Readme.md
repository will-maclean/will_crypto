My own little crypto library, mainly to get a better understanding of the
different components required in a crypto library. Includes, in various states
of functionality:
- Big integer support
- RNG (ideally, cryptographically secure)
- Prime number generation
- RSA keygen
- RSA encryption/decryption, including padding scheme
