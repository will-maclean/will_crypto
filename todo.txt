# Will RSA

Components:
- Big ints
- RNG
- Prime number generation
- RSA keygen
- RSA encryption/decryption (inc. padding schemes)


## Big Ints

subtraction be like

1.
	123
	-39
	---

9>3, so pull from the left

2.
	  1
	113
	-39
	---
	  4
13-9=4

3.
	 11
	013
	-39
	---
	 84
11-3=8

4.
	 11
	013
	-39
	---
	 84

0-0=0

5.
Done

So:
1. Starting at least significant digit
2. If b>a, carry in from the left (scan to the left until finding a digit
greater than 0, then pull it to the right.
3. We'll need to make a copy of a so that we don't modify the original data


## RNG

Need to check whether the linear thing is cryptographically secure (assuming
not).

If it is, figure out how to set a. b, m for safe operation.

If it isn't, find a good implementation and do it.

## Prime number gen

Whole thing stil todo. need to find an algorithm and implement it.

## RSA keygen

Check whether the correct results from the EEA are being used.

Other than that, nearly done?

## RSA enc/dec

Padding scheme and actual implementation details still remaining
